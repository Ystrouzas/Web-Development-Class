				<p>Don also enjoys working on his cars. When he was 16 he purchased his first car, a 1965 Corvette convertible that had been in an accident and arrived in two pieces when he towed it home.  At 17 he purchased a 1968 Corvette, and at 18 he purchased a 1969 Corvette. When he was 18, he had three Corvettes for a while. Finally, he sold the 1965 and 1968 Corvettes, and kept the 1969 (black) Corvette until 1985, when he purchased a new 1985 Corvette. Currently Don drives a 1998 Corvette which he recently modified.</p>
